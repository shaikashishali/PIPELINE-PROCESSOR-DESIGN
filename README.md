#DESCRIPTION:
The 4-stage pipelined processor is a simplified model of a CPU architecture designed to execute basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD in an efficient and structured manner. It divides the execution process into four distinct stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), and Memory/Write Back (MEM/WB), with each stage dedicated to handling a specific part of the instruction cycle. The pipeline mechanism allows for parallelism by enabling multiple instructions to be in different stages of execution simultaneously, thus increasing the overall throughput of the processor. In the instruction fetch stage, the processor retrieves the instruction from memory using the program counter, which is incremented in each cycle to point to the next instruction. The fetched instruction is passed to the decode stage, where the processor identifies the opcode and extracts source and destination register addresses. It then reads the required operand values from the register file for further processing. In the execute stage, arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction are performed using the values obtained in the decode stage, and in the case of a LOAD instruction, the appropriate memory address is accessed using one of the register values. Finally, in the memory/write-back stage, the result of the operation or the loaded data from memory is written back into the destination register.

This pipelined approach ensures that each stage is active during every clock cycle, processing a different instruction, which greatly enhances efficiency compared to a non-pipelined, sequential processor where each instruction must complete all stages before the next begins. The pipeline registers between each stage play a critical role in storing intermediate data, ensuring that each instruction progresses smoothly through the stages without interfering with others. The design initializes the instruction memory with sample instructions for testing, such as an ADD operation that adds the contents of two registers and stores the result in a third. The register file and data memory are also preloaded with values to support these operations during simulation. The processor operates on the positive edge of a clock signal and includes a reset mechanism to initialize the system state. Each clock cycle advances the instructions through the pipeline, gradually building up the simultaneous execution of multiple instructions.

The testbench for this processor sets up the clock, applies the reset signal, and simulates several clock cycles to observe the execution flow. It also includes VCD file generation for use with waveform viewers like GTKWave, allowing users to trace the activity of each pipeline stage and confirm correct data flow and operation. This design serves as an ideal platform for learning and experimentation, particularly in understanding the working principles of a pipelined processor and how basic operations are broken down and managed across different hardware stages. While the current design does not include features like data forwarding, hazard detection, or control logic for branches, it lays a strong foundation for implementing such advanced functionalities in future iterations. The processorâ€™s architecture can be expanded to support more complex instruction sets and optimized for better performance, making it a flexible and scalable educational tool.

In conclusion, the 4-stage pipelined processor represents a foundational implementation of pipelined architecture that effectively demonstrates the principles of parallel instruction execution. Its clear structure, basic instruction support, and simulation readiness make it highly suitable for students and developers aiming to understand CPU internals and pipelining concepts. Though simple, the design encapsulates the core advantages of pipelining, such as increased instruction throughput and efficient hardware utilization, while providing ample room for growth into more advanced CPU design elements. Through careful observation and simulation, users can gain valuable insight into how instructions propagate through each stage of the pipeline, highlighting both the power and the complexity of modern processor design.
